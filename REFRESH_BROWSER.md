# Files Are Pushed - Please Refresh!

## ✅ 30 Files Successfully Pushed

Your files ARE in Apps Script! The browser just needs to refresh to show them.

## Quick Fix:

1. **Hard refresh your browser:**
   - **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Shift + R` or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (clear cache)
   - **Windows/Chrome:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
   - **Or:** Close and reopen the Apps Script tab

2. **Check the Files sidebar:**
   - Look at the left sidebar in Apps Script
   - You should see all 30 files listed under "Files"
   - Files like `code.gs`, `config.gs`, `ae-dashboard.html`, etc.

3. **If files still don't show:**
   - Click the **refresh/reload icon** in your browser
   - Or try opening a **new incognito/private window** and going to:
     https://script.google.com/d/12vzYyfq9ooUhKbpbE5jvnvRvwIiF2CBWsRVYzDVjs8tnOWffDNC1Y1Rg/edit

## Files That Should Be Visible:

You should now see these 30 files in the left sidebar:
- code.gs
- config.gs
- sales-module.gs
- operations-module.gs
- ae-dashboard.html
- dashboard.html
- tech-dashboard.html
- ... and 23 more files

## If Still Not Showing:

Try pulling to verify files are actually there:
```bash
cd /Users/codylytle/Documents/Branch360
npx clasp pull
```

This will download the files and show what's actually in Apps Script.
